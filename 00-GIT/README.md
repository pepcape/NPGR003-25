# Task 00 - GIT repository setup
* Follow the instructions in the [root README.md page](../README.md).
  Briefly:
  1. Create **your own private GIT repository** – [GitLab](https://gitlab.mff.cuni.cz/) and
  [GitHub](https://github.com/) are two recommended platforms.
  2. Link the original (this) repository as **`remote upstream`** - you can use the command
  `git remote add upstream https://github.com/pepcape/NPGR003-25.git`
  3. Import data from the `upstream`, you will get the complete original repo,
  you will be able to update it (`git pull upstream main`) and keep it
  in sinc with `NPGR003-25`. However, you should work in the `solution` directory only.
  4. Grant us **permissions** ("reporter", "collaborator") to your repository –
  <https://gitlab.mff.cuni.cz/pelikan>, <https://github.com/pepcape> or
  <https://gitlab.mff.cuni.cz/isert>, <https://github.com/tomasiser>
* Don't forget to send us an email with **URL of your repo** and your **real name** (the first name and the surname)
* If your cell in the [shared table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17XuX5tgvh_E0u17Y4BXtQK-qVt1qnr9zAXVHGkYrNWs/edit?usp=sharing)
is colored, it indicates some kind of problem, try to fix it as soon as possible.
